# Power BI Internship Experience

This repository contains information and artifacts related to my virtual internship experience as a Power BI Intern at PwC Switzerland. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and develop impactful dashboards using Power BI.

## Projects

### Call Center Solution Report

The Call Center Solution Report is a Power BI dashboard designed to track call history and other important metrics for a call center. It provides insights into call volume, call duration, customer satisfaction ratings, and other relevant information. The report allows call center managers to make data-driven decisions and optimize call center operations.

### Customer Retention Dashboard

The Customer Retention Dashboard is a Power BI solution focused on analyzing customer behavior and identifying factors that influence customer retention. It combines data from various sources, such as customer demographics, purchase history, and customer feedback. The dashboard provides visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) to help businesses understand customer churn patterns and implement strategies for improving customer retention.

### Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard

The Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard is a Power BI project aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion within an organization. It consolidates data related to employee demographics, hiring practices, and employee satisfaction surveys. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations to highlight diversity metrics, identify areas for improvement, and track progress towards diversity and inclusion goals.
